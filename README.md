## Starpilot is like copilot, but for GitHub stars.

I've been starring repos for years thinking "This will definitely be useful later".

However I never really went back to them. 

Starpilot is a retrival augmented generation CLI tool for GitHub stars. 

Starpilot helps this problem by allowing you to search through your stars to find the right repos for the project you're working on right now.
